# DR-000: Initial Specs Structure

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Projects need a standardized structure for specifications to support iterative development and collaboration between AI and humans.

## Decision

Use `iteron init` to create:

```text
specs/
├── decisions/    # Decision Records (DRs)
├── iterations/   # Iteration Records (IRs)
├── user/         # User-facing specifications - what the system does
├── dev/          # System internal specs for development - how the system is built
└── tests/        # Test case specifications
```

### Initial Directories

| Directory | Format | Naming |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| decisions/ | [ADR](https://adr.github.io/) (Architectural Decision Record) | `NNN-<kebab-case-title>.md` |
| iterations/ | Goal, deliverables, tasks, verification | `NNN-<kebab-case-title>.md` |
| user/ | [GEARS](https://sublang.xyz/ref/gears-ai-ready-spec-syntax) | `<kebab-case-component>.md` |
| dev/ | GEARS | `<kebab-case-component>.md` |
| tests/ | GEARS | `<kebab-case-feature>.md` |

GEARS syntax pattern:

```text
[Where <static precondition(s)>] [While <stateful precondition(s)>] [When <trigger>] The <subject> shall <behavior>.
```

| Clause | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| Where | Static preconditions (features, config) |
| While | Stateful preconditions (runtime state) |
| When | Trigger event (at most one) |
| shall | Required behavior |

Test cases map Given-When-Then: Given → Where+While, When → When, Then → shall.

Subdirectories optional for user/, dev/, and tests/.

### Initial Files

| Path | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| `decisions/000-initial-specs-structure.md` | This DR |
| `iterations/000-spdx-headers.md` | Initial IR |
| `user/meta.md` | GEARS syntax guide |
| `dev/git.md` | Git workflow rules |
| `dev/style.md` | Authoring conventions |
| `tests/spdx-headers.md` | SPDX headers verification |

## Consequences

- Consistent structure across iterations
- Clear separation of user-facing and internal specs
- Test cases decoupled from iterations for traceability
