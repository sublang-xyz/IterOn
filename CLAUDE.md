## Specs (source of truth)

- Canonical specs live in `specs/`. Start with `specs/spec-map.md` for a quick-reference index of all spec files.
- Before making changes or suggestions in an area that has a spec, read the relevant spec file(s) first and follow them.
- If unsure which spec applies, search `specs/` and propose the most relevant file(s) before proceeding.
